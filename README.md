The primary focus of this application is to provide users with a highly enjoyable and customizable music
discovery experience.
Often it is desirable to have the ability to seek out new music by "rolling the dice." Say I want to find a brand new
indie-rock song. With one simple click, I can make this happen. If I like the song, I can save it in a playlist along
with however many other discovered songs I see fit.

Have you ever found a song on Spotify, saved it for later, and then checked back to see that the song you found
had been removed from Spotify? It sure has happened to me (By the way, if you ever hear a slow, moody jazz song with
dark, sweeping Tenor Sax, let me know about it -- It might be the long lost song I've been missing from my Spotify Jazz
playlist for a couple years now). To avoid this, my app gives you the ability to enter in song information for whatever
song you'd like to your playlists. So if you're paranoid that tomorrow U2 might take down all their music, go ahead and
create a U2 playlist!

This application was created as a way of honing my skills in full stack development.
